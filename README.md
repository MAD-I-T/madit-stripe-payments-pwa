# madit-stripe-payments
This is a reactJs extension for magento pwa-studio frontend.

This is the free/opensource version, a more complete pro version can be downloaded [on our site](https://www.madit.fr/shop/product/pwa-studio-stripe-integration-15).

This module requires [stripe backend module](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/stripe-stripe-payments.html) as well as our paid magento [backend module](https://www.madit.fr/shop/product/pwa-studio-stripe-integration-15). Alternatively you can use [scandi-pwa stripe backend](https://github.com/scandipwa/stripe-graphql) instead which is somewhat functional and free.
