# madit-stripe-payments
This is a reactJs extension for magento pwa-studio frontend.

This is the free/opensource version, a more complete pro version can be downloaded [on adobe marketplace](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/madit-stripeql.html).

This module requires [stripe backend module](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/stripe-stripe-payments.html) as well as our paid magento [backend module](https://www.madit.fr/shop/product/pwa-studio-stripe-integration-15). Alternatively, one can use [scandipwa stripe backend](https://github.com/scandipwa/stripe-graphql) instead which is somewhat functional and free.
